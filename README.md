<p align="center"><i>Command Line Tool as well as GUI based color blindness simulator</i></p>

## Introduction

On an imported image, ColorMuse simulates the following types of Colour Blindness :

1. Protanomaly

2. Deuteranomaly

3. Tritanomaly

It then gives you the option to change the hue so that colours in the image are easier to see for someone who has the chosen type of colorblindness.

## Concepts Used

1. Using conversion matrices for color correction 

2. Shifting the hue for making the image more distinguishable for a color blind individual

3. Taking the hue shifted picture and convert with color matrix
